# ImplOad
When writing a JavaScript library, argument type checking and value swapping means you have to keep track in your head of what combination of values does what. This is inefficient, difficult to read and hard to maintain. ImplOad (**impl**ementation overl**oad**) is a light-weight JavaScript library for function overloading. ImplOad provides chainable overloads, so you can declare as many or as little overloaded functions as you like. Declaring an overload is as simple as adding a couple of symbols and parenthesis and semantically and visually integrates with normal JavaScript function declaration.
